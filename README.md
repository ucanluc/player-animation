# player-animation

This is a sanitized version; 
- All paid assets, and dependant code have been removed,

- Only the code supporting the movement demo video is included.
- Is as close to the version in the video otherwise.
- The fun stuff starts in the FixedUpdate of LimbedBody.cs script.
- I would love to hear feedback about the whole thing.
